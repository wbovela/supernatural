a commodore 64 game by Georg Rottensteiner
Use the ACME cross assembler to assemble. Play on an emulator or the real C64 hardware.

This is a series about video game programming on the Commodore 64 in MOS 6510 assembly. As a guide I am using Georg Rottensteiner's code to the game called Supernatural, which was later made commercially available as Guns 'n' Ghosts. Georg created a tutorial series online in which he went through the code step-by-step. 

With this series I am trying to learn game programming while at the same time provide some entertainment for my YouTube viewers. I am hoping for this video series to become a record to accompany Georg's tutorial series.

I am using Georg's Integrated Development Environment (IDE) called C64Studio. If you want to code along, please visit my Github page where I provide access to the code as the project develops. Please find the necessary links below:
